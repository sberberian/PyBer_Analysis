# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The results below were developed for the ride-sharing company, Pyber, based on their copious amounts of data for ride fares, types of city, amount of drivers, and riders. This report is intended to illustrate total weekly fares and how they relate to each type of city: suburban, urban, and rural.

From the graph above, it's evident that the rural fares appear to be the most stable but also the lowest. The suburban fares have the most progressive and incremental changes over time. Urban fares are marked by clear peaks and dips and they also have the most expensive trend line. Each city type does experience a peak towards the end of February though. 

## Summary

It might help to investigate the consistent peak in February and see if perhaps it's somee kind of seasonal trend or related to a holiday. It coud be beneficial to increase the amount of drivers around holiday periods in the rural areas since those appear to be the most dependable time to expect service. Lastly, a possible business strategy for the urban cities could be to stabilize the trend. They return the highest fares likely because they have the most variety and ease of access to different places, bu they're also based on a faster pace of life. It could be an incentive to use rideshare more regularly if discounts are offered more in these areas.
